# TimerHub

Welcome to Timerify, a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to provide 
a collection of timers for various purposes. This app aims to enhance 
productivity, time management, and daily routines by offering 
customizable timers accessible across different devices.


## Limitations

 - iOS Sound Compatibility: There are reported issues 
   with sound functionality for PWA apps on iOS devices. 

 - User Interaction for Sound Playback: There needs to be user interaction
   before the app is allowed to play sounds.

 - Offline Functionality: While PWAs theoretically work offline, there are 
   uncertainties regarding the app's behavior in scenarios such as device 
   resets or prolonged period of internet connectivity. Further research is 
   needed to understand and address potential challenges in maintaining 
   functionality during offline periods.
